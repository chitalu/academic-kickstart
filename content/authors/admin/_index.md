Floyd Chitalu is a computer science postdoc at the University of Edinburgh. His research interests lie primarily in the domain of physical simulation, collision detection, geometry processing, and parallel computing using GPUs. He has developed efficient techniques for simulating fracture, constructing and traversing bounding volume heirarchies, and cutting tools for mesh geometry modelling. He is expecially motivated to invent algorithms allowing users to exploit the potential of these technologies for personal, academic and industrial use cases.
